### Hi there World ðŸ‘‹ I'm Brigita

- ðŸ˜„ I'm a Data Science enthusiast currently sharpening my skills at HyperionDev's Skills Bootcamp. ðŸŒŸ
- ðŸ”­ Right now, I'm diving deep into mastering Python, data analysis, and machine learning techniques through practical projects and hands-on experience. My journey into the world of data was sparked by my time as a Sales Operation Team Leader for a mobile recycling company, where I stumbled upon the magic of data-driven decision-making.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm geeking out over advanced data visualization techniques using libraries like Pandas and NumPy. Also, I'm digging into statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms, discovering something new and exciting every single day.
- ðŸŒ³ When I'm not head-deep in data, catch me wandering the vibrant streets of London or chilling out in one of its gorgeous parks. As a nature lover, I recharge my batteries surrounded by trees, soaking up the sun and finding inspiration in the great outdoors.
- ðŸ“« Want to chat? Hit me up on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/brigita-stankeviciute-9099601aa/). I'm always down for a good chat about all things data science!
- âš¡ Fun fact: Despite calling London home for the past four years, this lively city still manages to surprise me with its energy and diversity. And believe it or not, I still manage to get lost in its maze of streets every now and then!
